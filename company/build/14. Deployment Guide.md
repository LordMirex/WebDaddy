Document 14: Deployment Guide

This guide explains how to launch the application on a cPanel-based hosting environment.

Prerequisites: You must have a registered domain, a valid SSL certificate (for HTTPS WhatsApp redirects), and cPanel access to the hosting account. Ensure the server supports PHP 7.4+ and has MySQL/MariaDB. Also verify an email/SNMP server or SMTP credentials are available for sending emails via PHPMailer.

Deployment Steps:

Upload Files: In cPanel’s File Manager, navigate to the public_html/ directory and upload the website files. A common approach is to zip the project folder locally and use the cPanel “Upload” feature, then extract the ZIP in public_html
dev.to
.

Set Permissions: Ensure correct file permissions (usually 644 for files, 755 for directories). In cPanel File Manager, use the “Permissions” tool as needed.

Create Database: In cPanel, open MySQL Database Wizard. Create a new database (e.g. user_templates_db) and a new database user, granting it full privileges

.

Import Schema: With the database created, go to cPanel’s phpMyAdmin, select the new database, and import the provided SQL DDL script to create tables (users, templates, orders, etc.)
docs.cpanel.net
.

Configure Settings: Edit the includes/config.php file (or similar) in the project to set the database host/username/password, WhatsApp phone number, email SMTP settings, and any other environment-specific values. Do not hardcode sensitive credentials anywhere else.

Initial Test: Browse to the site URL. Verify the landing page loads without errors. Log into the admin panel with the initial credentials. Test the order form and ensure emails/WhatsApp links are generated. If issues arise, check cPanel’s error log (e.g. /usr/local/cpanel/logs/error_log) and Apache’s error log to diagnose.

Rollback Plan: Before deployment, take full backups of the existing site files and database. If deployment fails or a critical bug is found, you can restore from these backups. Keep backups in a safe location outside of the server if possible.

Monitoring: After launch, monitor the site’s error logs via cPanel and ensure scheduled tasks (if any) run. Periodically place a test order to confirm the WhatsApp redirect and email notifications work.

In practice, deploying a PHP app to cPanel involves uploading the code to public_html and configuring the database. For example, upload a ZIP via File Manager and extract it
dev.to
. Then use cPanel’s MySQL Wizard to create a database and user

, and import the SQL schema via phpMyAdmin
