Key Terms

Affiliate
An admin created partner with a unique code who earns commission on sales attributed to their code. They get a simple dashboard and request withdrawals.

Affiliate Code
Short unique token admin assigns to an affiliate. It appears on public links like ?aff=CODE and persists via session or cookie for attribution.

Pending Order
A server record created when a buyer fills the onboarding form. Status remains pending until admin confirms payment after the WhatsApp conversation.

Domain Inventory
List of pre-bought domains that admin maps to templates. Domains are marked available or in use. When assigned to an order they are hidden from public selection.

Template
A prebuilt website offering in the portfolio. It contains metadata like demo path, price, thumbnail, and custom field definitions for the order form.

Demo iframe
In page preview area that loads the template demo inside an iframe so the user does not leave the site. Admin page demo can be loaded into same iframe and prefill credentials via postMessage if same origin.

Pending Commission
Amount shown on affiliate dashboard that represents commissions earned but not yet paid by admin. Admin processes payout requests manually.

Referral Code
Optional code a buyer or informal referrer shares. Referral code in MVP gives buyer a discount and credits referrer with maintenance credit; referrals are tracked but applied manually by admin where needed.

Session Aff Persistence
Mechanism that stores affiliate code in session and cookie for 30 days so purchases made across pages still credit the affiliate.
