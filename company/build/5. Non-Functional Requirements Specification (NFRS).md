Non-Functional Requirements Specification (NFRS)
Performance

Page Load: Templates listing and detail pages should load quickly (<1 s ideally). Achieve this by caching the template list page for 60 seconds and optimizing all media (e.g. compress images, serve WebP).

Scalability: The system should easily support the initial target (~50 sales/month) on a cPanel host. Use MySQL indexing on key columns (template IDs, affiliate codes) to keep queries fast as data grows.

Frontend Efficiency: Minimal dependencies (plain PHP, Bootstrap) ensure pages render without lag. The use of Bootstrap’s CDN and no heavy JavaScript frameworks means performance overhead is low.

Security

Transport Security: Enforce HTTPS on all pages and forms.

Input Sanitization: All form inputs must be sanitized/escaped (e.g. using mysqli_real_escape_string() or prepared statements) to prevent SQL injection.

Authentication: Admin and affiliate passwords are stored as secure hashes (password_hash()). Sessions use secure cookies. Implement measures against brute-force login (e.g. lockouts or CAPTCHA after several failed attempts).

Data Protection: Sensitive data (affiliate bank details, user emails) is stored securely in the database. Regular backups (via cPanel or cron) should be configured to protect against data loss.

Error Handling: Do not expose stack traces or SQL errors to users. Log all errors server-side and display user-friendly error messages.

Usability

Mobile-First UI: Use Bootstrap to ensure the site is fully responsive. The interface should work well on smartphones and tablets.

Simplicity: Use clear language and very simple forms (only essential fields). Non-technical users should easily navigate: for example, labels like “WhatsApp Number” and a short description on the order form help guide the user.

Validation Feedback: Provide immediate feedback on form errors (e.g. highlight missing fields). After submission, clearly show the WhatsApp chat opening, and on return warn “Remember to save this conversation!”.

Admin Usability: The admin panel should be logically organized (e.g. tabs or menu items for Templates, Domains, Orders, Affiliates). Use consistent form layouts and confirmations (e.g. “Domain marked sold!” alerts).

Reliability

Backup and Recovery: Schedule regular database backups (daily or weekly) via cPanel. Store backups off-site or download copies to guard against server failure.

Error Logging: Log application errors and admin actions. In case of failure (e.g. email send fails), notify the admin with an alert in the dashboard and log details for troubleshooting. Use server logs and a simple PHP try/catch around critical sections.

Fault Tolerance: If an email or WhatsApp link fails to deliver, allow the admin to manually resend credentials. The system should not crash on external failures.

Data Integrity: Use foreign keys (where possible) to maintain referential integrity (e.g. a sale must link to a valid pending_order). Upon domain assignment, ensure no two customers share the same domain ID.

Maintainability

Modular Code: Structure the PHP code with includes (e.g. separate files for header, footer, DB connection, functions). Keep code DRY. For example, have a single function to generate the WhatsApp message text, and one to send emails via PHPMailer.

No Frameworks: The system uses plain PHP (no Laravel/React) to keep it simple. This lowers the barrier for future edits (the developer can read and modify straightforward PHP code).

Documentation: Comment the code and keep an updated schema diagram. Use clear naming conventions for variables and database fields. Maintain a short README or wiki explaining setup steps (e.g. where to configure the WhatsApp number or email SMTP settings).

Testability: Write simple scripts to test key functions (e.g. database inserts, affiliate code persistence). Ensure any new developer can deploy or extend the system without reliance on proprietary libraries.

Sources: The above requirements are based on the agreed architecture and feature list, as well as best practices for security and performance.
