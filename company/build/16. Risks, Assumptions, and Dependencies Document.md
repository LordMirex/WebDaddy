Document 16: Risks, Assumptions, and Dependencies

We maintain a RAID log (Risks, Assumptions, Dependencies) to track potential blockers and conditions:

Risks: (Possible problems and mitigations)

User confusion (Low): Users might find the WhatsApp ordering step unclear. Mitigation: Add clear instructions on the site and form (e.g. “Click the WhatsApp button to confirm your order”).

Order fulfillment delays (Medium): If the admin forgets to mark orders as paid, customers could be left hanging. Mitigation: Implement reminder alerts or a dashboard view of pending orders.

Domain inventory shortage (Medium): Popular templates may run out of domains. Mitigation: Track the count of available domains per template, and alert admin when stock is low.

Assumptions: (Things taken as given)

All customers have access to WhatsApp (web or app) on their devices.

The admin team can process orders manually each day (no fully automated payment pipeline).

Affiliate links will be shared by trusted partners; we assume affiliate traffic is legitimate.

Dependencies: (External and internal components)

External:

WhatsApp Web: The service that receives orders (via wa.me URL). If WhatsApp changes its URL format, the app must update.

PHPMailer / SMTP: The ability to send emails depends on PHPMailer functioning and the SMTP provider being operational.

Internal:

Admin Configuration: The system relies on settings stored in the database (like WhatsApp number, commission rate). A corrupted settings table could disable core features.

Hosting Environment: Requires cPanel (or equivalent) with MySQL and email sending. (Loss of hosting service or email capability would halt operations.)

In project management, tracking Risks, Assumptions, and Dependencies is standard practice
