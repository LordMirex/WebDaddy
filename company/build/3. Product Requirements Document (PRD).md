Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Objective and Success Metrics

The PRD outlines a fast-converting portfolio site for selling pre-built website templates. Customers can preview templates, select an available domain, fill a short form, and start a WhatsApp chat with their details pre-filled. Admins manage domain inventory and affiliates; after payment via WhatsApp chat, admins mark orders as paid, assign domains, and email credentials. Success metrics include a click-to-order flow under 30 seconds, admin order processing within 15 minutes of payment, and 100% affiliate tracking accuracy on orders that include a code.

User Roles and Personas

Public Visitor (Client): Non-technical user browsing the template portfolio. Can preview demos and place an order via WhatsApp.

Admin (Agency Manager): Manages templates, domain inventory, customer orders, and affiliate accounts. Responsible for marking domains sold, recording customer details, and coordinating fulfillment.

Affiliate (Partner): Brand ambassador or celebrity with a unique referral code. Admin-created account to view total sales and commissions, and request withdrawals. No access to templates – only earnings and payout history.

User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

US-01 – Browse Templates: As a Public Visitor, I want to see all available templates with thumbnails and prices so I can pick one. Acceptance: The homepage shows template cards with images and prices; each card has a View Demo button and a Get This Website button.

US-02 – Demo Preview (iframe): As a Visitor, I want to open a live demo in an overlay iframe so I can try a template without leaving the site. Acceptance: Clicking View Demo opens the demo URL in a full-screen modal iframe. A close button (Back/Close) closes the overlay.

US-03 – Order Form → WhatsApp: As a Visitor, I want to fill a minimal onboarding form and launch WhatsApp with my details pre-filled to start the payment chat. Acceptance: Submitting the form creates a pending_order record in the database (including template selection and customer info), retains any affiliate code, and redirects the user to a wa.me chat link with an encoded order message.

US-04 – Affiliate Persistence: As a Visitor referred by an affiliate link, I want the affiliate code to persist if I navigate, so my purchase credits that affiliate. Acceptance: If the URL has ?aff=CODE, the system stores the code in the session and a cookie (30-day expiry). All pending_order records include the affiliate code when present.

US-05 – Domain Inventory & Sales: As an Admin, I want to add domains, assign them to templates, and mark them sold when purchased, attaching customer details and notes, so inventory remains accurate. Acceptance: The admin panel allows full CRUD on domains. When marking a domain as sold, the admin can enter customer info/notes. The domain’s status changes to in_use and it no longer appears in the public availability list.

US-06 – Affiliate Dashboard & Withdrawals: As an Affiliate, I want to log in, see my total sales and pending commissions, and submit withdrawal requests with bank details. Acceptance: The affiliate portal (login-protected) shows total sales, total commission (earned and pending), and a form to request payouts. The admin can approve or reject each withdrawal request.

US-07 – Reporting & Export: As an Admin, I want to export CSV reports of sales, domains, and affiliate earnings for a given date range. Acceptance: The admin interface provides filtered CSV exports for orders, domain inventory, and affiliate commissions.

Non-Functional Requirements

Tech Stack: Plain PHP (7.4+), MySQL (5.7+), hosted on cPanel; Bootstrap 5 for the responsive UI.

Security: Enforce HTTPS; sanitize all inputs to prevent SQL injection; hash affiliate passwords (using password_hash()); protect user sessions.

Performance: Cache the template list page for at least 60 seconds and optimize images (e.g. WebP) to ensure fast loads. Aim for sub-second page loads. The system is lightweight (no heavy frameworks), so no significant lag is expected.

Prioritization (MoSCoW)

Must have: Public portfolio listing with live-demo iframes; a simple per-template order form that generates a WhatsApp chat link (preserving affiliate info); an admin panel for templates, domain inventory, and orders; affiliate management with unique codes and dashboards; robust record-keeping for orders, domains, and commissions; secure implementation (sanitization, hashing, HTTPS).

Should have: Affiliate code persistence via session/cookie for 30 days; a post-sale modal or email flow to deliver login credentials (with copyable text) after admin confirms the sale; CSV export reports (sales, inventory, affiliates); a clean mobile-first UI built with Bootstrap.

Could have: Optional online payment integration (e.g. Paystack) for future use; an email-template editor in admin; basic analytics (click-tracking per affiliate).

Won’t have (MVP): Customer-side user accounts or dashboards; full automation of domain provisioning or renewals; a public self-service referral program (only admin-managed affiliates).
