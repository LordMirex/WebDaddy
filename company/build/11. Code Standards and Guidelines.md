Code Standards and Guidelines
Coding Conventions

PSR-12 Compliance: Follow PSR-12 style: indent with 4 spaces (no tabs)
php-fig.org
, limit line length to ~120 characters. Start files with <?php on its own line, and omit the closing ?> tag.

Naming: Use camelCase for variable and method names, and StudlyCaps (PascalCase) for class/interface names. Method names must be camelCase
php-fig.org
. Filenames may use snake_case for clarity (e.g. order_list.php, domain_inventory.php) as long as naming is consistent. For class files, match class name to file name (per PSR-4) if using autoloading.

Directory Layout: Use the structure: public/, admin/, affiliate/, includes/, as outlined. Place public-facing PHP scripts in public/, admin pages in admin/, etc. Shared includes (config, functions) go in includes/.

Security Guidelines

Output Escaping: Escape all user-provided data on output. For HTML contexts, use htmlspecialchars($data, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8') to neutralize special characters and prevent XSS
eitca.org
. Never trust raw $_GET/$_POST values in HTML.

Password Handling: Store passwords using password_hash() and verify with password_verify()
tutorialrepublic.com
. This uses a strong one-way hash (e.g. bcrypt/Argon2) and built-in salting, as recommended. Never use weak hashes (md5, sha1) or store plaintext.

Session Security: Always regenerate the session ID after login or other privilege changes (session_regenerate_id(true)) to thwart session fixation
cheatsheetseries.owasp.org
. Set session cookies with the HttpOnly flag (and Secure if using HTTPS)
cheatsheetseries.owasp.org
. Store only a session ID in the cookie – do not put sensitive user data in cookies or URLs.

HTTPS: Enforce HTTPS for all sensitive pages. On cPanel, configure “Force HTTPS Redirect” or use .htaccess rules so that passwords and cookies are only sent over TLS.

Error Handling

User-Friendly vs Detailed: Show generic, friendly error messages to users (e.g. “Something went wrong, please try again.”), but log full error details internally. For example, catch exceptions and if in debug mode display a simple message, otherwise record the exception details in a log table or file
ibn-sultan.medium.com
. Do not expose stack traces or SQL errors to end users.

Logging: Log errors to an activity_logs table or file. Include timestamps, user context, and error info. For example, use a try/catch around PHPMailer and DB operations, and on catch insert the exception message and stack trace into activity_logs. This aids debugging without leaking info to the user.

Exception Handling: Use PHP’s try { ... } catch (Exception $e) { ... } especially around email sending and critical DB operations. For PHPMailer, enable exceptions (new PHPMailer(true)) and catch PHPMailer\Exception to handle SMTP errors gracefully

Version Control

Branches: Follow a standard Git workflow: keep main (or master) as the stable production branch, and use a dev branch for ongoing integration. Create feature branches (feature/xyz) for each new task or user story. Feature branches should have clear, descriptive names
atlassian.com
 (e.g. feature/order-form).

Pull Requests: Before merging, submit PRs from feature branches into dev. PRs should reference the issue or task number, explain what was changed, and link to any relevant tests or screenshots. Have peers review code style, security, and completeness.

Sensitive Data: Do not commit secrets (API keys, passwords, etc.). Add includes/config.php (and any .env files) to .gitignore
github.com
. Store such values in environment variables or a non-tracked config file. Only commit code and non-sensitive assets.
