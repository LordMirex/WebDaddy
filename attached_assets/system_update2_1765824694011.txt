Okay talking about the most important part of the website which is the conversion boosting is why when that user registers it just inputs just his email and verify the  OTP, then the input form goes away okay now what will happen is that for both automatic or manual orders by having the same flow for the email patterns because why is necessary for them to be able to complete that email from and we haven't making it very simple UI as it's very fast and dynamic so the page level ever reload during the whole personal information process okay then let's go back to individual orders how the system now we respond for individual orders let's The shorter one is for the automatic so let's start.


1. automatic payments: for automatic payments since the email or the login has been verified or the users verify the OTP code or the password was correct then the personal information tab was removed since the major thing are going to collect the is the email for login we just tie that okay this email is what will be used to process this order or this user account tied to the login is what to be used to process the order and the login you know it means you log in the session is already initiated so everything is happening you can be able to go back and track and do other things but the major thing for registration you see that it does not enter password because we don't want to board the or stress the user to increase our conversion we just ask him to verify his OTP code this is his first time I want to actually know the process so just make it simple for him verify your OTP code after you verifying then you see okay that's all for now you won't even know that's all for now so we just see select a payment method and if you select automatic payment method that's what this step is for then after I select continue now there's no heaven in need for a Name section a name cause our clients might want to hide their name for most that full name so we're mostly using username that is login in with an already existing email and password is data is profile that is user profile I've read me already be updated with is username and password but for this user now that is the first time using the system and only verified this email address right now that means that that payment is tracked with that email that user account so even when the user right now does never have a username we are mostly using their email for the payment so that payment is that email that is useful tracking it and for automatically once the order is initiated or completed or failed for automatical they many things that can happen here:

i. You know that the payment process with paystack is just the user email since so we don't have a constraint complication with the users that are just that just confirmed the OTP code, which are fresh users then after the payment if immunity the order is initiated the order is tied to that user account created so for after the meeting the form is initiated the order is tied to the user account created without email I was verified I said I will talk about the update of the user account later, but here is something that can happen if the payment was completed successful and the other marked as paid, just like before we have our confirm page but now the confirm page is now more matured because instead of seeing just a random confirm page the user now is now rage a registered user or a logged in user so yeah the two scenario. 

a. If the user use the login method for existing users then the session is already initiated so the confirmation page is just now like in a use not just a random confound page that we just vanish is now like going to the user dashboard now and see okay payment payments made for that order and the user will see the delivery is to be like a that specific order now the confirmation page now will not be specific for that other let me say something you are real like our url/ users/orders.php?confimed=17. That's just an example I don't really know how they will look like what I'm saying that that confirm confirm page we actually have now is not actually tied to a user account so it's just like user account ever assist it ever again which is the which is why this update is being implemented it mean implement after their accounts have been created so they can just go to that ordwr ag to see status and delivery updates of that order and this means that the delivery system and infrastructure now will now be showing to the users properly and advanced, in a way that for delivered orders like templates they were able to see their credentials you know is still sending to email but now able to see that credentials their tool filles and others  different from currently  that once they leave that confirm URL that can never access it so you see how this order is very important for a user that logs in you don't finish, and also for the users that entered and verify just that their email address will the OTP it will be then a half account because they also be taken to the confirmation page of the confirmation there will be things like buttons and to be saying continue and that continue will be continue to call to complete account creation they already on the user base but they will now be continued to the account update page that page now for this is for new account creation ohhh, then that's nice immediately they are order don't be able to even do anything maybe we'll just we just block it with you overly or something just telling them that update your your distance update your account details then you will come back here this is to make sure that user don't leave that page without adding their password and other information we need this is where I go to a very important phase which is updating the account it will be like that more than they say update that more than that is blocking them immediately it will still be on that page you just on top of the form just feeding the form the order success form at the back at the background and also this more than now that is the update continue with the update it's just another a model of pop-up now that is the form it will be on it will be three steps to be stepped so that the user don't steam take fee long form it to be steps and the first step will be enter your password we had two password input we shall password and confirm password we eat them and tell him that they should use something simple that they can remember anytime then after the enter the password I confirm password they will press next after the next page now will be Enter recovery or backup phone number that they know that they are always with to receive OTP code and this this is the second part of the update modal is the second step because you have to be clearly showing them the steps so on this page now this is what we use a API to verify the phone number it will just be a simple input it will be it will be just phone number then at the right of the input it will be verified and I immediately phone number verification SMS OTP code will be sent six digit gotv call will be sent to that phone number then on what on a new input will then come out just how we did for the personal information page now the phone number then now that the OTP input now open for them to click the next the next button I will be the yes it will not be verified the OTP code is correct it's just like same OTP code we sent for the email then but now it's just for SMS it will be like there will be ux ui help like like resend OTP change the phone number and there will be agile so they don't need to refresh or reload the thing will just happening instantly but is not react you are using but I need you to help me do it, and after after that they will see a success tick and one thing I forgot is to tell you that the form the next next will be automatic so after the first modal ste page which is the Enter password and confirm a relative then enter the the two person and press next it goes to the next page but after they are verified the put the number and verify the OTP and when they click verify otifuse like the next page so if there's no errand the OTP is correct is them move to the next step and the next step is actually the last step because this is this last step is what we just write up test like the guidance and the about the this that user dashboard on how to come back here this is to for you to be able to come back remove us from the spam folder on your email and other things just like a short information or guide about how they how to use the website then they can press continue and pressing continue just complete the open process so you see that immediately the press continue that's all is done and the form is submitted then the mother is removed then I will be able to see their order that they paid for and be able to download it tools and see the templates that are pending and how long it remaining for the thing to be delivered just like a delivery status and that's that's what I can think of but they'll be more things on their dashboard like Amazon I don't know how they do it so help me work on how they can mix products user dashboard orders and everything together. Then another important part is that on on the bottom of the order you know is a automatic order on the bottom will be a button saying that confirm this order with the admin you know it's the automatic order with the we have received the the money on our pay stack but for the just make sure that tell the user that this continue is just like a form be admined that this was the status of this your order and others so this is to boost the speed of the delivery and the main use of this is that messaging us you will carry the preferred message from that order that was created and the user and user email or the user ID and the other ID just create a pre-med message and add it to the WhatsApp message I will be sent to the admin then this is the main use of this is just you know it's not a manual that we are processing the payment via WhatsApp this one the payment was already processed and the other was already confirmed maybe the user has already downloaded is yours Strict that will tell him that he should message us on WhatsApp you know why this is important, because now on the admin page there will be a input form a it will be like for  the user listings or user categories of the admin is just like a place where the admin can normally add the WhatsApp and or edit the WhatsApp number of a user and this this is another important thing I don't know if you can add it to the to the form or the edit creation form yes add it is like on that phone number aspect yes and that second steps second step. It will be optional though so we can tell them that add WhatsApp number then the phone number will be um mandatory that phone number is phone number they can use to receive code. I know why this part is very important because you have to tell him that if they lost their email access to the email so we can see know that they are the owner or maybe they want to change the email address or something kind of privilege we are going to send OTP code to their phone number or email so with having a phone number they can receive SMS it's very good in case they lost that email address and this will reduce the stress on customer service okay I will that I hope you understand everything remember after the now you're adding WhatsApp to the step two which is the phone number and WhatsApp number just make the two mandatory but we don't confirm the WhatsApp number we don't need to confirm it make that too many issue because do you for the user to message us to confirm the order or to talk about the other when they already paid was to make sure that we can get their WhatsApp number and copy it manually to the user section on the admin but now me reasoning it and I know that some users may use another phone or public devices and they might not be WhatsApp on that system for you to message us directly on WhatsApp so entering the WhatsApp number will be good so that on any other confirmation or delivery is sent to both their email and WhatsApp to email is automatic then you WhatsApp will be done by the aadmin Manually. I just hope you understand all these.  But if the email or the user is a log is a login user in the first place that is on checkout page is logged in and will not need to enter any information again but just see personal information like just something like you are logged in us the username or the email you see me talking about username I forgot that on the steps the update steps so on the update steps the first step will be vote for him for username then password then confirm  password. Then when you tries automatic payments and use automatic payments on the confirmation page you then go to the user so the user order confirmed page which now they can come multiple times and see the list of orders and enter and see order deliveries for every order, and no need for the update modal block again since it's already a user or is already existing user for that is for users that login in oh so you will just see the page I'm already have his details and everything so we are we really don't need much things let me just confirm order via WhatsApp to just talk to their admin more thto is just to make sure that the users are admin are keeping touch via WhatsApp and on the steps from that second step that contain WhatsApp number why is very important is that for the delivery that's the WhatsApp number on the user database that they admin will deliver the product or the credentials to.

Besides you have to you have to also find a systematic way to handle field order you know right now you just saying fade and retry so you know that for field order maybe they might be asked to retry or continue again without other on their account or then I just skip the order and continue and verify OTP he has to update that is information before closing that browser because the account has already been created and it's been logged in so we don't have to have a uxui should they should be a way that I should update it even if the transaction faied or even if it's not buying the products again make sure you handle al steps



2. Let's talk about manual payments now, you know that for automatic and manual payment the order the order is created immunity the press continue either from automatic or manual but automatic the order is completed and marked as paid, omanual parents now when users if the user is just just says that is that is enter his email is actually a user and we see that he enter his password that is correct then we just removed the user base and say logged in us they user then when you select manual and clicks um process just like others or before the other excreted to that user already created and is register so no need for any updates and it learns on his user pieces the other teeth and created as payment as pending or or the payment has not made this is the account I don't know how you do this part to but for manual orders it should be a very good ui ux, because it's very important as the current stages is kind of faulty when it comes to the confirmation of the creation of order of manual because the page creates the other give them the account number to pay to then give them clear instructions about the payment and they have two options either to pay now that is copy the account and pay and say I have sent the money they have sent the money button with open WhatsApp and tells the user that receipt to the message, then there's another button that says p via WhatsApp so they will don't need to 7p via copy the account they can just go to WhatsApp chat about the product first before they actually  pay, because that will have more knowledge on the product but now that we are making the system a system that they will create your account that is this that is once stage I need now so what happen is that now that we are not processing any update on the website see the user have not paid I want us to process those type of things when you use our paid but you know sometimes some users will will never pay some I just give up on the on the other and live so that's where this step is important I need, since I know that they might not pay if they come to WhatsApp first without updating their profile here is why this place is important they need to complete their update on the website but we need to do it in systematic way after they said that the okay that is two steps that is it will be like two forms but just the step one is the update update profile steps so that we already click that they want to use manual payment so I already showed that this person might be willing to pay so what we do then is load the a page that other created other created then you see fill this um update your new account form to make sure that you can track this order delivery and payment confirmation via the website even if they admin is not around or if you lose control to your email by this time is the order on his profile is already on pending so it will be like a more than I see blocking it you to not be like a mother it will be the update for more than just okay is created on the background why this model blocks it and we are telling them to feed the form that same form of the automatic which is username password confirm password then they confirm their phone number and WhatsApp number but we verify just the phone number then after they feel feel the data finish then the modal close then they sees the the option of pain with the account number and they will see the they will see their order then they will see the WhatsApp or continue and the two is it collect the preferred message you remember and that's I think that's all I have to say for the manual automatic orders and account creations so you are the one to improve it and have more light on it
