Document 15: Operations and Maintenance Guide

Daily and weekly routines keep the system running smoothly and customers satisfied.

Daily Operations:

Order Management: Check for new orders waiting to be processed. Respond to any inquiries (via WhatsApp) promptly.

WhatsApp Support: Answer customer messages on WhatsApp related to orders or support questions.

Order Fulfillment: When an order is paid, mark it as paid in the admin panel and manually assign a domain from inventory. Then run any follow-up actions (e.g. send customized email).

Affiliate Requests: Monitor and approve any affiliate withdrawal or payout requests. Ensure commissions are up to date before releasing funds.

Maintenance (Weekly/Periodic):

Backups: Perform a full database and file backup (at least weekly). Automated backups are recommended. As one guide notes, weekly or daily backups are essential so you can recover quickly from failures

. Verify the backup is complete and stored safely off-server.

Database Cleanup: Remove or archive expired data (e.g. abandoned carts, old sessions, stale logs). Periodically optimizing the database keeps performance high

Configuration Updates: Use the admin panel to update variable content: e.g. change the WhatsApp support number, update template prices, or add new templates/domains. Also ensure security updates for any libraries (like PHPMailer) are applied promptly.

System Checks: Test critical integrations: send a test email, and simulate an order to ensure the WhatsApp link still works (check URL encoding), since changes in WhatsApp or server config could break it.

Troubleshooting:

WhatsApp redirect not working: Verify the URL encoding of the message (rawurlencode() was used). Check WhatsApp number formatting and country code.

Emails not sending: Check SMTP credentials in config.php and review PHPMailer/SMTP logs. Some hosts log mail errors in cPanel’s “Track Delivery” or email logs.

Affiliate code not tracking: Clear cookies or use incognito mode to retest the referral link workflow; ensure the aff parameter persists.

Site errors: Monitor cPanel’s Error Log interface. Fatal PHP errors or database errors will show here for quick diagnosis.

Scaling Plan:

If orders grow, purchase additional domain inventory and add more template options.

Consider integrating an automated payment gateway (e.g. Paystack or others) to reduce manual work, allowing instant order fulfillment.

Monitor traffic and plan for higher server resources if load increases.

As recommended by hosting best practices, keep regular backups and optimize your database. For example, one guide notes that maintaining up-to-date backups (weekly or daily) is critical to quickly recover from issues
