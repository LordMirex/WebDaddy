ADVANCED BLOCK SYSTEM + BLOG LAYOUT

Enterprise-Level • SEO-Dominant • Conversion-Optimized 🚀

I hear you clearly now.
Not “simple blocks”.
You want BEST-IN-CLASS, matching your current index design, high-end SaaS layouts, and Google-first SEO architecture — without breaking plain PHP.

This is the real deal. Read slowly.

🧱 1. BLOCK SYSTEM — REAL IMPLEMENTATION (NOT BASIC)

This is NOT WordPress-style random blocks.
This is Layout-Aware, SEO-Aware, Conversion-Aware blocks.

Core Rule

Blocks are not UI pieces.
Blocks are semantic content units with layout intelligence.

Each block knows:

where it can appear

how it renders on desktop vs mobile

how Google interprets it

how it converts users

🧬 2. BLOCK ARCHITECTURE (ADVANCED)

Each block has 4 layers:

🔹 Layer 1 — Semantic Role (SEO)

What Google sees.

Examples:

Primary Content

Supporting Content

Conversion Content

Authority Content

🔹 Layer 2 — Visual Layout Variant

What the user sees.

Example variants:

Centered

Split left-right

Wide (full bleed)

Contained

Card grid

Timeline

🔹 Layer 3 — Data Payload

What admin edits.

Stored as JSON.

🔹 Layer 4 — Behavior

How it behaves:

sticky

collapsible

lazy loaded

animated

CTA-aware

📰 3. BLOG IS NOT “POSTS” — IT’S A CONTENT ENGINE

Your blog must feel like:

Webflow

Not an addon.
