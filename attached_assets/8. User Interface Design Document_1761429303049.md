User Interface Design Document (Document 8)

Design Principles: The UI follows a clean, modern, mobile-first approach using Bootstrap. We emphasize simplicity and readability: a neutral color palette (similar to GitHub’s brand style – mainly blacks/whites with a green accent
brand.github.com
) for backgrounds and text, with a single bright accent color (e.g. green or blue) for calls-to-action. Typography and spacing adhere to accessible standards. Because Bootstrap is inherently responsive and mobile-first

, we ensure layouts stack vertically on small screens and expand to multi-column grids on larger screens. The design avoids heavy scripting: no large JS frameworks are used, keeping pages fast and lightweight (just Bootstrap’s minimal JS for components).

Wireframes:

Home Page: Features a hero section and a grid of all active templates. Each template card shows a screenshot, name, key features, price, and buttons for “View Demo” and “Get This Website.” A sticky header nav (with links to sections) remains visible.

Template Detail Page: Shows full details of one template. Includes the live demo in a full-width iframe/modal (the user can toggle a preview on demand). Below the demo are a list of features, tutorial videos (if any), pricing, and a prominent “Get This Website” button.

Order (Registration) Form: Presented in steps on one page. Example layout:

Step 1 – Your Information: Form fields for Full Name, Email, Phone, Business Name.

Step 2 – Select a Domain: A dropdown or list of available domains for that template (from the domains table where status='available'). If none are available, a message like “No domains available for this template” is shown.

Step 3 – Review & WhatsApp: Shows the final price and a “Proceed to WhatsApp” button. (Any affiliate code from the URL is already applied behind the scenes.) Clicking proceed saves the order and opens the user’s WhatsApp with a prepared message.

These steps may be visually separated (e.g. Bootstrap cards or accordions) but kept on one page for simplicity. Validation errors (e.g. missing phone) display inline.

Success/Confirmation Page: After initiating the WhatsApp, a simple “Thank you” page appears, summarizing the order details and asking the user to continue in WhatsApp. It also informs them the admin will follow up. This page can display the support WhatsApp number in case the automatic link fails (as a fallback).

Admin Dashboard Page: A clean, tabbed interface (using Bootstrap nav-tabs) shows quick stats (total sales, inventory counts). Separate pages for managing Templates, Domains, Orders, Affiliates, and Settings use tables and forms. For example, the “Domains” page lists each domain with its template, status, assigned customer, and action buttons (mark available/sold, edit notes). All forms use standard Bootstrap styling.

Navigation Flows:

Public User Flow: Home → Template Detail (via “View Demo”) → Order Form (via “Get This Website”) → WhatsApp chat.

Admin Flow: Admin logs in → sees Dashboard (or redirect to Orders) → can navigate to Templates / Domains / Orders / Affiliates / Settings pages → can confirm orders (mark paid) or edit inventory.

Affiliate Flow: Affiliate logs in (admin has pre-created them) → sees Dashboard showing total clicks (tracked by landing on site with their ?aff= code), total sales, commission earned, and a form to request withdrawal.

These flows ensure the user has a clear path from browsing to purchase, and the admin/affiliate have straightforward access to management functions.

Accessibility Guidelines: We follow WCAG basics. All interactive elements (buttons, modals) include ARIA roles/labels as needed; for example, modals use role="dialog" and proper aria-labelledby

. All images and icons have meaningful alt text (e.g. template preview images have alt=”Screenshot of [Template Name]”)

. Color choices ensure sufficient contrast (Bootstrap’s defaults generally meet WCAG AA). The HTML is semantic: <header>, <main>, <nav>, <footer>, etc. We include a “Skip to content” link for keyboard users (using Bootstrap’s .visually-hidden helpers). Forms have associated <label> tags, and focus order is logical. These practices help screen-reader and keyboard users navigate the site.

Responsive Behavior: Using Bootstrap’s grid and utilities, the layout adapts to all screen sizes

. On mobile, template cards stack in one column; navigation collapses into a hamburger menu. The demo iframe is sized to fit the viewport (e.g. full-width up to a max). On tablets/desktop, the template grid becomes multi-column. The order form steps collapse into a single column form on narrow screens. We test breakpoints to ensure no overflow or cut-off content. All pages include the <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> tag for responsiveness

. Thus the UI remains usable and clean on phones, tablets, and desktops.
