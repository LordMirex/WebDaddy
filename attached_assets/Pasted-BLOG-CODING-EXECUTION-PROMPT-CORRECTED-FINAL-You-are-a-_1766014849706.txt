BLOG CODING EXECUTION PROMPT (CORRECTED & FINAL)

You are a senior PHP engineer working inside an existing codebase.

MANDATORY FIRST STEP (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

Read blog_implementation.md in full.
This file is the PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRUTH for:

NB: You said that you are done with Phase 1 AND 2 i just hope they are okay, So now you are not building just check properly for any errors, imcompleteness in Phase 1 and 2 so we can fix all of them now and make sure you code properly and make sure that its complete, before moving forward and also make sure you are ticking and updating the guide properly 

Architecture

Code patterns

File structure

Code examples

Read blog_code_execution_guide.md.
This file is ONLY to:

Track current phase

Know what has already been implemented

Know what must NOT be re-implemented

HARD RULES:

You MUST follow blog_implementation.md exactly.

You MUST NOT skip, reorder, or merge phases from the execution guide.

You MUST stop coding when the current phase is completed.

You MUST reuse existing project utilities, helpers, config, and session logic.

IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVE:
Implement a production-grade, block-based blog system in plain PHP + MySQL, fully aligned with the current project.

BLOG SYSTEM CONSTRAINTS:

Dynamic blog index, category pages, and single post pages.

Content rendered from ordered blocks stored in DB.

Exactly 8 predefined block types (no additions).

One H1 per post. Semantic HTML only.

ADMIN CONSTRAINTS:

Extend the existing admin system.

Do NOT create parallel admin logic.

Admin manages posts and blocks using patterns defined in blog_implementation.md.

SEO & CONVERSION CONSTRAINTS:

Follow SEO rules and layouts from blog_implementation.md.

Sticky conversion rail and mobile CTA must match existing site design.

AFFILIATE CONSTRAINTS:

Blog pages must respect existing ?aff=CODE session/cookie logic.

Affiliate context must persist across blog → CTA → order.

No registration dependency.

FAIL CONDITIONS (STOP IMMEDIATELY IF ANY OCCUR):

Treating blog_code_execution_guide.md as a coding reference.

Deviating from examples in blog_implementation.md.

Implementing future phases early.

Refactoring unrelated parts of the system.

Code cleanly, minimally, and deliberately.
This blog system must be SEO-dominant, fast, and maintainable
