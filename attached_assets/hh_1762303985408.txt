Alot of things are working now but they are still some bad things am seeing especially in importance page like affiliates, some are layout breakdowns, like the earnings 4 containers in affiliate the amounts are too big and are coming out on mobile, even on the admin some modals have inconsistent width like on settings, and also tables status like in use are something broken when too long or something, even some pages modals on the admin/affiliate.php are not working like the three email all, notifications and the other
For the beautiful landing page I want it to even be better because that categories at the beginning of templates is making it ugly, so I would prefer a modern nice seach filter div that has good and short height and also very responsive and fast instant querying also am scared of the page crashing so I would love beautiful pagination implementation for templates listing 10 each and also works perfectly with the search or category professional design, too many blank space on the footer close excess space, and also the WhatsApp floater should be able to be interactive and attractive like beautiful pop and fading out cta, like got an idea 💡, about we bring it to life, you get the point, it's not that clear to me yet but help me

For affiliate and admin I can't see my site logo instead you are busy using stupid big icons to represent site icon, I need my site icon on the signing/registration page and also on mobile I can't seem to see the site name I only see a cash icon, I would prefer the affiliate actual seeing the site name Everytime on their dashboard for any device, even if it means reducing the size or breaking it so webdaddy up and empire down and also make the coloring perfect, just in same affiliate page some designs look wack and even the analytics container ft view count and all is not responsive enough because amounts are too large and breaking out of the conter which I don't ever want in my site on any page at all, and also there's an important update I need you to help me research and implement, is my affiliate-discount and their pay, am seeing that am loosing 50% of profit because of it, I don't know if it's really how is done for companies, but I still want users referred by affiliate to get 20% off  every purchases but the issue is that I don't want the affiliate to receive 30% of the total amount of te product without the 20% cutout because imagine a refered user pays me #80,000 instead of #100,000 and I still go ahead paying the affiliate #30,000, but instead I want to pay him 30% of the amount paid by the user that's 30% of the 80,000 and that 80,000 is what the affiliate would see as the amount paid so it won't be like is being cheated, but this is just my opinion if you have something better please tell me.

Stop on the affiliate the nav bar (header) trash work on it 
And I don't know but it seems you destroyed the withdrawal and account number placing because non is working anymore, even to apply for withdrawal won't work, for the tools.php I love what you did there but not that the website urls are all https not http, I can't see any customers support or a way that the affiliate can message us, either on the site or showing them our WhatsApp number, and also checking the affiliate settings.php I think is broken, there's this thing that have being bothering me since and that's the notification, why is it not going, I would love more handling on the admin side so the admin can send to a particular affiliate, set timer or how long it should last or how many times they can see it because is just on my affiliate dashboard right now pilling up and won't leave



Now to the details page this is not needed (2 domains available) I would prefer something better so it doesn't kill conversion when I run out of domains or forget to add domains



Now fr the admin section it also have its prices and count containers broken on mobile especially for the report page right now just had all the amounts popping out of the container, and please improve that chart I need something more mature. and on pages that have a top right or left buttons, some are broken just like the add bulk domains on domains.php, lie also I can't see my site name or PNG on the header, tho the nav bar is killing it 👍 but they are some little rearrangements I love to do, I don't like bulk domain on the nave bar, I want it to be a modal or something inside the domain php page, so on that page I should have add domain and add bulk domain well layout and responsive, both the orders status column and template status column are having same ugly breaking even in short wolds like in use and something like available breaking from the small icon which I don't appreciate, now for the affiliate page is the worst because the three  Email All Affiliates, Post Announcement, Create Affiliate) are not responding wen clicked and theres work here because I don't want a email affiliate on nav bar but I want it here so there are going to be a lot of updates here, like individual affiliate email, notifications/announcement remove the option of custom commission rate and in the affiliate details modal something is breaking the layout and it's the referral link div being irresponsive and making the width break wider, then. add to the nav bar a very important file and this will be database, because it will help me visualize and analyze all the data on my app from the DB, and it will have many production ready task like empty a specific row/table or backing up or downloading backup things like that even clearing things like full table data at once
