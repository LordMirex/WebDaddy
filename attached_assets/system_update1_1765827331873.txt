Okay are you ready, this is just a update I want to implement is just about adding a user and account interface this is the only thing that is needed for is actually for easy tracking and confirmation of orders it it will just change the system of booking instead of it will reduce the form for the the user input form on the payment page I could make it easier for users to confirm payments.


Okay for the updates this is what I actually want before we talk about the UI and the ux interface let me brief you on the back end logics and you are going to expand this because this is just a rough idea I have so the issue came the update issue came when I discovered that what if users now want to track their other delivery or at the time of buying the tools the mistake mistakenly entered a wrong email  address or a wrong phone number and after the paid a huge amount of money or bought a website or a tool from us and data loves their own or their device or lose access to some of the things they should be able to actually log in back into the system like love to have a user base that they can access and see their others their formal orders the tools see the delivery status that the deliveries have been completed so instead of now or others being individual now others are being tied to users accounts like their email account creating their account so a user instead of a user in putting his email address or is details everything we can just simply tight to a user account so it make the system more better for me as an admin and help the system for a good review so we won't have bad review about um products management and loss of credentials especially for website where the buyer forget their website credential details.




Here is how it goes, the current infrastructure is just a index page it doesn't have a user base is just a index page a template view page then there's a affiliate folder for affiliate account and others and there there is a admin account for admin and administrative privileges so you see that the issues that we don't have any user folder so not that I'm really looking forward for user folder out because you know one thing that made me made the website like this before is because I don't want users to be stressed while creating an order and I just wanted them to come to the website buy their website he puts the credentials like that email their name the WhatsApp phone number then the process the other either with paystack or process it via WhatsApp but either ways is still their data that they use on that check out page that is tied to the other which means that every time they are creating an order they have to pass through that step every single time which which heaven live I know that okay it's better than them having to be cramming a password or having their emails other exact password in mind I remember that what are what we didn't happen if even after the the website details or the details or are delivered to their emails and their WhatsApp even at that what if the user loss is WhatsApp chat or even is phone containing his email and everything that way you have lost the credentials that he paid for and there's no way for me as a admin to do anything about that because I won't then have enough proof that is the one that purchased or paid for this specific order when it doesn't have access to those credentials again or or email account, that way we will lose our trust and looking at all scaling and using big affiliate and trusted people it will be very bad for those people who lost their credentials now wanting to go get the details and they can't get it there will be given bad reviews of our system and how we can't help them and our customer service that is the main purpose of this improvement



So now let me start with the key features that we are going to do and I need you to do more of the work because right now I'm not a I'm not a ux UI designer so I don't know what how these changes are going to happen especially changing the navbars or the index visual how to look like what we change how the carting system will not be like how the checkout system not be like, so that way now it will make me to need you mostly for this project to add as a very experience developer and ux UI architect



Form the little ideas I have and how think that since I was trying to make sure that user don't log in or sign up or have to think about registration of account I'm still keeping to that in a way that I'm making the UI seem very easy for the user that they don't even experience any delay to everyone know that they have to register then I will make sure that after the user logs in on that device they don't ever have to ever bother about login in because we make sure that the login section or the credentials last for up to a year even if when I know that this is not that secured but I would why I will tell you that is secured because there's no really things that we compromise will be compromise if another person have access to that phone because on the homepage under his only user side what the major things we are building it for is for customer service so there will be a support session where the user will be able to send support text and subjects and message to us to the admin and the admin will be able to reply and use that I can even add screenshot and upload things like that there will be tracking very good tracking because now since all others I tried to the  the account or that specific account for that order an orders all used by that phone or that user email or login session this is because the user account systems wont even be noticeable to the user, so something like the index page now I want to even need showing that there's a login on registration button there it will job be like something like track order then that track order it to only be registered users that will no everybody should be able to see it but when they pay when they goes enter trying entry degree just logging us our permission to enter this is because maybe someone lost their other ID then they just come to track the order since the session is already lasting for up to a year the thing he didn't even have to log in again but for someone that use a new device it will not see the login email and password session that is what you just impose and it will enter so that track other is just like a gateway to enter the user base something I don't know you you have you have to discuss the UI changes our apple on most pages especially the navbars, but the major improvement that this this will make is simplifying in order and the conversion that has because having their emails and their account will be able to simplify the tracking and the email notifications and announcement properly now so be able to email email users account with promos or bonus code or just a custom message or notification to the dashboard just like that of the affiliates and many more you are just the one that will mildly decide how the number is going to change for public pages like the index page the template page the yes just those to the cart page what what will show, even the new admin page that will happen that the the new admin pages that will be created on user management section which was not existing before and you know that this update is is very very crucial because it will help for good system reviews I need to create a very big change difference to the database and its system because most things not like the others the deliveries and now mostly tied to the users



But the only thing I'm sure is this workflow I want to tell you I've discussed this with my colleague and this is the system I'm creating and it's just for the cart  and delivery user system, I would like you to work on and think about the others so yeah yes that it goes let's do a scenario for the currency system let me show you for the current system and what will change.


1. For manual orders let's work on that access you see for manual orders when the user add to cut and select what they want currently we don't even we don't have user system so when they when they want to check out they will have to fill the name email and WhatsApp number this is because after the other has been processed manually would then message they will message us first to with the screenshot to of the transaction to complete the to say that there are payment was completed they may as an admir go to the admin dashboard and confirmed that order before then the uh deliveries are sent to their emails but as an actor that but there's no other way that they can access it apart from their email unless me as an admin then go to the WhatsApp and tell them that your details have been sent to email and there's no way for me as an admin currently to even copy the data or the credentials of the purchase or the delivery and sent to them via WhatsApp so you see now that if they lost their email address or their login to the Google account that will they have lost total Access to that product because imagine me as an admin I also lost my WhatsApp account then I won't be able to now be able to track if this user is actually the user that paid for this product to be able to resend it again maybe when he message me again I was the one that bought this order, so that way now we are having a a broken system dear and that will create very bad reviews if if we have a big pole of users like Imagine having 100 users losing their emails that will be very bad reviews that that can result to loss of about 200 credentials and  it will be stressful for the admins to be able to be has answering those in Quarry message that I lost my information I lost my credentials what is the area of my website what is this what is this there will be flooded so the customer service will be flooded and that will be bad for our customer service because the system isn't isn't even automated for the admin to copy the template credentials or the tools credentials so to be very bad that is why now creating a user base for the user we make sure that even if the loss that data the only thing we are going to do is just tell them back to your account or help them retrieve their account another dashboard they will see all these information that will lost from their mobile, okay here is the improvement we are working with now the improvement is that for manual orders now when the come to the Checkout page before apart from the affiliate input there is a personal information input where the user inserts his name is email and WhatsApp  number,  then they will select the others manual then they will continue to to purchase which will not send them to the other created page and it'll be displayed with the manual account number for them to send the money to and after they send it they will screenshot it and  continue the purchase by our WhatsApp whereby they can chat US about the product before they even pay or after they pay that's just that flow but you see now if they now after the other have been completed then I come back there's no way imagine the purchase the the order seven there's no way for that user to come back to our website and track that order seven this is because it's just on our database and our admin please but the user has no privilege to see it just on the WhatsApp that he can receive information by the admin that okay your detail website is ready you or this is ready and details will be sent to your email so check your email. Even when this infrastructure took me long to build them now I'm seeing that is kind of trashy because what if the person now loss that is email address even was even what if when was entering the email address he made a mistake so you see that the delivery won't even process at all because our system was not even checking if the email was correct and me as an admin I want to be able to even know if if paying for that order if he's the is the actual person that book that order you can just see a someone just come to my DM and say um I bought other 70 I will just send a receipt and pay meanwhile is not the actual one without email without to be very bad. So yes the proposal making now for the improvement when the user lands on the check out page maybe has had several orders to the cart, to simplify the whole system I thought of having the personal information section just displaying email address enter email address then this form on the website would be very dynamic in way that the page don't reload or do anything the the we just use Ajax to process the queries or the forms under same page so the user knows that okay the steps before I push I go to even select manual I have to confirm verify my email, so to make it cool now to even make sure that there is no wrong email address entered on our system yes what will happen on the person information from there will be a email address input and at the right there are two will be on a row the email address will take six columns they verify button we take four columns that is for the 12 columns on the road the verify button will be a fast Ajax button what we are going to do with it is that when the user enters that email and click verify while doing a lot of things here now on the back end first the back end will check that is this email our user is this email on the user rule on our database if yes if the answer of of that query is true if yes what will do is that what we didn't ask him that enter your password then the the Verified button we we slide Away close to the email and click very fair we remove the email and now add enter password for social account so maybe the user account on the email address so no more input form for email s for email and verify right now to be password and login since is already a existing user and is not currently login is using a new phone because you know that the sessions last for the year unless you clear the cookie, then immediately the user enter is password and clicks login the address is it processed and if the the password entered match the email on the database user role, then we'll just animate a way the old personal information section and we just say login successful than animate it away then the user will then see the process to enter for automatic ammanual so you have seen that this process I said right now is working for both automatic and manual on the Checkout page so it's not even specifically for manual since the heaven confirming their user personal information before they go and select the the payment method inputs at the bottom so they have to complete that personal information and we know before it was named and password now we have simplified it to just entering your email and verify and what I've discussed is just for if the email that the user entered was on our database the then was asked to enter his password, then he logged in then the system says login successful then that personal information section is animated away then you can continue with his with the selection of automatic or manual then process the form to the next stage so now let's deal with the second scenario.


2.  Scenario 2 now is just dealing about when the user email is not on the database that is when it clicks when enter is email and click verified we didn't see  it on our database, meaning is a new user email or is a user using a new email that have not been used before so it's just like is a new user to our platform so what we do is that as we search that it not before the the scenario one it will first search if he's a user and if it's a user today asking for his login password then there will be a login button that is after the email input have been removed those things already got it then after the password and login button then the login all those personal details information will be removed because it's already saved so that order that is about to be created but now for this narrow that when the um condition was seen that the email is not on our database what to then do is that you have to become now because this is a is a crucial part what to do is that we send the user a confirmation email order for the first time we have to pass through before the heaven do about the scenery one with login in what will happen is that we see that the email is not our database, the system will send a six-digit OTP code to the email and this will this the sore purpose of this is just to make sure that the user inter is correct email so what will happen then is that would they remove the just like how we did for the login will then remove the enter email and submit up or confirm button they will not bring out a OTP input and confirm button so you see that the personal information form is doing a lot of work code will be sent with a template that is just designed properly it will be sent to the user then on the page that you are asking the user to enter the OTP code you tell him that you should check his spam on his email and if it does not see it issue we check his email then you have on this text that we are writing for the help who have things that will be like 60 second timer there will be this will be like a text to just like professional website do we just mean like please check your sperm for the email and if you have not seen the email between the last 60 seconds and this time I will be counting down so after the countdown is when the resend both team will them be active for clicks then I'll be something that if we check your email because the email will be shown at the top like with text H1 things that check this email for your for the confirmation code then if you don't tell the user that if you see that your email is not correct you check the look at the email properly that if it's not correct  now they will not be another link text saying change email address it will just be like change email so once the user clicks it it will still be dynamic and to be Ajax what would you do it to do is that if you just start you process it will just start the opposes of putting the email and verify if the email is on our database and if still not on our database will then send the OTP code again and and create the proper that OTP code for me again telling him that he should go and copy the in the OTP 6 digit OTP on his email and come and paste it here so what will happen now is that if the user copies it and paste it two things can happen if the is a wrong OTP code, it will be asked to enter the right OTP it this form will just show and wrong OTP and you'll be asked to enter a right one then after the 60 seconds you'll be able to send the OTP code then the other thing that can happen is if the OTP code is correct then you were able to be complete the process will be complete then after the code is correct this is the name point of this old personal information section after a person after that email is correct that he received it he just shows that okay is the owner of that email address and the email address is correct so you can later send update and details to that email then what will not do is that we remove the o personal information form. You see that trick that trick is just to make the user know that there's no actual registration or login on our system, registration even now that is making is is first order is not even asked to enter email and password but we are doing it in a very dynamic way where we can both process existing accounts and new account at the same time I'm for a new users to improve conversion that is why I say after the email have been confirmed we remove the personal information from is known for our business again, and this is one of the most important part of the website because are these stage the account is created just without email address and is verified so that account is already verified and active but there's no password yet remember when the the form other users will login in the way entering password that is what I will explain to you later.
