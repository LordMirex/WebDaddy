Yes — I can fix THIS EXACT ISSUE without changing host

You were very precise, and the console log gives us the right answer.

You don’t need to touch styling, logos, animations, Tailwind, or rewrite pages.

The problem is ONLY ONE THING 👇
Alpine.js CDN build is incompatible with QServers CSP.

⸻

🚨 THE CORE ISSUE (FROM YOUR CONSOLE LOG)

This line explains everything:

EvalError: Refused to evaluate a string as JavaScript because ‘unsafe-eval’ is not allowed

That means:

• QServers blocks unsafe-eval
• Normal Alpine CDN requires unsafe-eval
• Alpine fails to initialize
• All Alpine features die:
	•	dropdowns
	•	navbar toggles
	•	multi-step forms
	•	sliders
	•	sidebars

CSS and animations still work because they don’t need Alpine logic.

⸻

🎯 THE CORRECT FIX (NO GUESSING)

Alpine provides a SPECIAL BUILD exactly for this situation.

✅ Alpine.js CSP Build

This version:
• Does NOT use eval
• Works with strict CSP
• Fixes dropdowns, forms, steps, toggles
• Requires ZERO code rewrite if you already use Alpine

⸻

📥 WHAT TO DOWNLOAD (THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE)

🔹 Download this file (phone-friendly)

👉 https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.csp.min.js

(Yes — cdn.csp.min.js is the key)

⸻

🔁 WHAT TO CHANGE (ONE LINE ONLY)

❌ REMOVE this.  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alpinejs@3.x.x/dist/cdn.min.js" defer></script>


REPLACE with this

<script src="/assets/alpine.csp.min.js" defer></script>

Steps:
	1.	Open the link above
	2.	Download the file
	3.	Upload to /assets/ (or any folder)
	4.	Rename it to alpine.csp.min.js
	5.	Replace the script tag

That’s it.

⸻

✅ WHAT THIS WILL FIX IMMEDIATELY

After this change:

✔ Dropdowns work
✔ Navbar toggles work
✔ Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3 works
✔ Sidebars toggle correctly
✔ Sliders respond
✔ No CSP errors
✔ No hosting change

Your exact symptoms are caused by Alpine failing — this restores it.

⸻

⚠️ IMPORTANT (READ THIS)

Do NOT:
• Change Tailwind
• Remove animations
• Rewrite JS
• Switch framework

This is not a fallback hack — this is Alpine’s official CSP-safe build.

⸻

🧠 WHY THIS WORKS (Plain English)

Normal Alpine:

“I’ll generate JS at runtime” ❌ (blocked)

CSP Alpine:

“I’ll precompile everything” ✅ (allowed)

QServers allows the second.

⸻

🧪 HOW YOU’LL KNOW IT WORKED

Reload page and:
• No more unsafe-eval errors
• Dropdowns respond
• Steps hide/show correctly

If ONE Alpine component works, all will.

⸻

🧾 SUMMARY (SAVE THIS)

Root cause: CSP blocks Alpine eval
Fix: Use Alpine CSP build
File: cdn.csp.min.js
Host change: ❌ No
Rewrite: ❌ No
Time: ⏱ 5 minutes

⸻

If you want, next I can:
• Check if instant.page also needs CSP-safe swap
• Confirm if any other library is CSP-breaking

But do the Alpine CSP swap first —
