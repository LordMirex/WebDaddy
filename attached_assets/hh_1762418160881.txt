**FULL DEVELOPER BRIEF – TALK THROUGH EVERYTHING**  
*No lists. No bullets. Just plain, deep, conversational instructions so your developer hears your voice and builds exactly what you want.*

---

Look, I’m tired of seeing half-done things. I open the database and I see tables like `penny_orders` and I’m asking myself — what is this? Is this real orders or some test the last guy left behind? I don’t want you to just delete it and move on. **Open it. Look inside.** If there are real customer orders in there, even one, you take every single row and you move it properly into the main `orders` table. You rename the table to something clear like `pending_orders_backup` so I know what it was, and you make sure nothing is lost. If it’s empty or full of garbage, then yes, delete it. But **you don’t assume**. You check. That’s the kind of care I want.

Same thing with `page_visits` and `page_interactions`. I saw those tables and I thought — okay, someone was trying to track what users are doing. Good. But right now, there’s no dashboard, no report, nothing I can open and say “Aha, this page is dead, nobody clicks here.” That’s useless. So don’t throw them away. **Use them.** Build me a real analytics section in the admin where I log in and the first thing I see is: how many people came today, where did they come from, which template got the most views, how many bounced off the landing page in under 10 seconds. I want to see search terms people typed. I want to know if someone searched “resume” on page 5 and didn’t find anything because the search only looks at the current page — that’s stupid. Fix that. Make the search go through **every single template** in the database, no matter what page the user is on. When they hit search, take them straight to page 1 of the results. Show me “12 results for ‘resume’”. If nothing, say “No templates found. Try ‘CV’ or ‘portfolio’.” That’s how real sites work.

Now, the announcement thing. There’s this file called `announcements.php` and it’s broken. I don’t even want it. Delete it. Burn it. It’s gone. But I **do** want announcements — just not like that. You know that modal that pops up when I’m managing affiliates in `admin/affiliate.php`? That’s where I want everything. When I click on an affiliate, the modal opens, and inside it, I want a clean tab that says **“Announcements”**. Not a new page. Not a popup. Inside the same modal. I want to see every announcement I’ve ever sent — date, title, who it went to, whether it was sent or still a draft. I click one, I see the full message. I want a button that says **“Send New Announcement”**, and when I click it, I get a form: title, message (I want to be able to bold things, add links, make it look nice), and then **who it goes to**. Not just “all affiliates”. I want options:  
- All affiliates  
- Just this one affiliate  
- Affiliates who made more than 5 sales  
- Affiliates who joined in the last 7 days  

And I want to schedule it. Not just “send now”. I want to say “send this on Friday at 9 AM”. And I want to choose: send in-app only, or email too. And before I send, I want a **preview** — show me exactly what the email will look like. Then I hit **Send** or **Save as Draft**. That’s it. All inside the modal. No leaving the page. No `announcements.php`. Gone.

Support tickets — same story. I see `support.php`, I see tables in the database, I see some backend code. That means someone started it. Good. Now finish it. But first, **test the backend**. Can I create a ticket from code? Does it save? Does the admin get an email? If not, fix that first. Only then build the frontend. On the customer side, I want a little **“Help”** button floating on the bottom left, near the WhatsApp thing. They click it, a clean modal opens: subject, message, upload file, and it auto-fills their name, email, and last order number if they’re logged in. They hit submit, it says “We’ve got your message. We’ll reply soon.” On the admin side, I want a full **Support** tab in the dashboard. I want to see every ticket in a table: ID, customer name, subject, status, when it was last touched. I click one, it opens in a modal with the full conversation — their message, my reply, back and forth, nice and clean. I can reply, change status to Replied or Closed, and when I hit “Send & Close”, it sends the email and marks it done. No broken flows.

Now, the affiliate commission — this is the **heart** of the system. This has to be perfect. Let me walk you through it like I’m explaining it to a child. Product costs ₦10,000. Customer comes with no affiliate link — they pay ₦10,000. Done. Customer comes with John’s affiliate link — we give 20% off. So they pay ₦8,000. That ₦8,000 is now the **real sale amount**. Not ₦10,000. ₦8,000. From that ₦8,000, John gets 30%. That’s ₦2,400. We keep ₦5,600. That’s it. No confusion. But right now, the admin report shows ₦10,000 sold, and John sees ₦2,400, and he thinks we’re stealing from him. That’s poison. So fix it.

On the **checkout page**, when discount is applied, show this clearly:  
> “You saved ₦2,000 (20% off) thanks to John Doe!  
> Final price: ₦8,000  
> John earns ₦2,400 from this sale.”

In **John’s dashboard**:  
> “Referral sale: ₦8,000 (after discount)  
> Your commission: ₦2,400 (30% of final amount)  
> → Clearly stated: from discounted price”

In **admin sales report**:  
> Order #123 | Original: ₦10,000 | Discount: ₦2,000 | **Final: ₦8,000** | Affiliate: John | Commission: ₦2,400 | **Platform: ₦5,600**

No one gets confused. No one feels cheated. Everyone sees the truth.

The WhatsApp button — I love that it’s there, but it’s too big, it’s in the way, and the animation is cheap. I don’t want it gone. I want it **smart**. Move it to the **bottom-left corner**, touching the edge of the screen. Make the icon small — 40 pixels. Just the WhatsApp logo. Then, when the page loads or when someone hovers near it, a little message **slides out to the left** smoothly, like it’s coming out of the button. And it changes every 6 seconds:  
- “Need a custom website?”  
- “Let’s bring your idea to life”  
- “24/7 support on WhatsApp”  
- “Templates from ₦5,000”  

It slides out, stays for 5 seconds, fades, slides back in. Next one comes. It’s not annoying. It’s helpful. It tells a story. And when they click, it opens WhatsApp with:  
> “Hi! I’m on [current page name] and need help.”

Use Tailwind and a tiny bit of Alpine.js. No Bootstrap. No jQuery. Clean.

Templates — I want **exactly 9 per page**. Not 10. Not 8. Nine. Page 1: first 9. Page 2: next 9. When they scroll near the bottom, load the next 9 smoothly. URL must show `?page=2`. Simple.

The database viewer — `database.php` — right now it’s a disaster. Popups, errors, “faith to faith” nonsense. I want to open it and feel like I’m using phpMyAdmin, but better. Left side: list of all tables. I click one, two tabs: **Schema** and **Data**. Schema shows me every column, type, if it allows null, default value. Data shows me 20 rows at a time, I can search, sort, go to next page. I want a button to export that table as CSV. At the bottom, a box where I can write any SELECT query and run it — results come back in a nice table. And I want a section called **“Backup Schedule”**. Dropdown: Daily, Weekly, Monthly. I pick one, hit “Generate Cron Command”, and it gives me a copyable line:  
```bash
0 2 * * 0 mysqldump -u root -p'mypass' mydb > /backups/db_$(date +\%Y\%m\%d).sql
```  
I copy, paste into server, done. No migrations. No nonsense.

Weekly/monthly — forget products. That was a mistake. This is **only for database backups**. Nothing else.

---

**What you deliver:**

- `database/database.php` → all SQL runs here  
- `database/schema_updates.sql` → I can import manually  
- `database/full_backup_2025_11_06.sql` → full current state  
- `database/cron_backup.txt` → the copyable cron line  
- `TASK.MD` → this file  
- All changes in code, no migration folder, no Bootstrap, no broken modals

---

**Test this flow yourself:**  
1. Create product: ₦10,000  
2. Use affiliate link  
3. Checkout → pays ₦8,000  
4. Affiliate dashboard → shows ₦2,400 commission  
5. Admin report → shows ₦8,000 final, ₦2,400 to affiliate  
6. Send announcement to “affiliates with >5 sales” → scheduled for tomorrow  
7. Customer submits support ticket → admin gets email → replies → customer gets email  
8. Search “resume” on page 5 → goes to page 1, shows results  
9. WhatsApp CTA animates smoothly  
10. Database viewer works, cron generated

If all that works, you’re done.

Now go build it. No excuses. No “I thought you meant”. This is what I mean.

[11/6, 7:31 AM] MirexTech: I've observed several issues with the website. There are numerous tables, including page visits, page interactions, and a ticket table, which suggests that the previous developer had started implementing some features. However, it's now up to you to consolidate everything, remove any unnecessary tables, and ensure a cohesive structure. On the frontend, I've noticed that certain features are missing, such as WhatsApp support and other support options.    And can you imagine that it's very stupid because it's like only when I check at the database schemer I will now know that okay this feature is supposed to be here why? Implement the features on the front end and for the ehm the admin they are clashing they admin announcement is clashing that is why I say admin announcement is clashing is because I don't want announcement to be announcement dot PHB I want announcement to be at that athlete page and it should be a model that is a screwable model no need for you to be a single page I don't want page or because that athlete dot PHB is the one covering both the emailing of athletes the creating of due athletes account and everything so I don't want it separate or the announcement on the nerve what I will now want now is because the ehm right now the announcement is still not working so work on the announcement put it on the model update the model delete that page of announcement put it in the model and make it work on the model that will be one then the support ticket or the support that I think because I saw a support ehm schemer I thought that the admin now the nerve buyer is supposed to be updated with support and be able to receive and send support but I'm still not seeing anything like that oh you see and another issue is that how about the the one I haven't thought that was okay which was the page analystics and user ehm interaction and ehm usage like bounce rate and everything there is report maybe that report is already on the nerve I think okay that one will be for financials it should be it should be on there should be on that nerve maybe ehm ehm analyst track track a user ehm analystics or something yes user analystic or something like that that will now tell okay this page is not visiting this page how many users we got today how many users visit this athlete how many users did this how many users came from this how many users came from this this this this all those type of things and I I those are just the schemers I saw there are more schemers that have not even been implemented and there are some schemers that are having error imagine you created a table called penny orders I I am confused because penny orders is not supposed to be orders and even if the other page is okay well I'm doubting that there is some there is a issue there and the sales I'm still doubting that there is a issue there so I need good work not this bad work you are doing
[11/6, 7:37 AM] MirexTech: [11/6, 7:35 AM] Meta AI: Here's a polished transcription of your message:

"Also, I need you to do a thorough check and fix on the system, particularly the main strong code which is the payment and commissions, specifically the half-lit commissions. Here's how I want it to work: the total price of the product is displayed, and if a user comes without a half-lit code, they pay the full amount. However, if they come with a half-lit code, we remove 20% from their payment, and that discounted amount becomes the total cost of the product. We will then give the half-lit 30% of that sale for referring the user, and this 30% will come from the discounted price, not the total price.

"I want to ensure that the half-lit understands that their commission comes from the discount price, not the total price, so they don't feel cheated. Additionally, when the half-lit registers, they receive a registration message, but they need to remove us from their spam folder to receive future notifications. Can you also create a custom automatic announcement for the half-lit, welcoming them and reminding them to check their spam folder to receive important notifications about orders and payments?"

Let me know if this captures your intended meaning accurately!

[11/6, 7:41 AM] MirexTech: It seems like you're pointing out that some features or tables related to the current clone job (specifically, weekly, bi-weekly, and monthly options) are missing from the admin database PHP file. You'd like these features to be added to the database so you can easily copy and set them up on your server.
[11/6, 7:41 AM] MirexTech: You're in the development stage and prefer a straightforward approach. You'd like all database changes to be written directly into your DB file and SQL files, without using migration files. This way, you can easily hand over the project to someone else, and they'll just need to host it and clear the database if needed. You understand the potential benefits of migrations, but for your current needs, direct DB changes work better for you.
[11/6, 7:45 AM] MirexTech: What are you doing? I just saw Bootstrap on a five hundred dot PHP meaning that if it's there, if Bootstrap because it's supposed to be till wind after the penetration, Bootstrap is still on the code, it mean Bootstrap might be someone else too in our code base so work on that and also the landing page, the landing page reduce the size of that WhatsApp because my users are complaining that it's eh intruding the view so reduce the size of that WhatsApp deave under so it's like not much blocking the screen while there is an important thing I want to tell you, for the search, that search search on the landing page, when even if they are on page one or page two or page five when they search for something, you are able to know that the search will query all the all the pages because imagine eh someone is looking for a template and he is on page two so you are telling me if he search on my landing page, you can't see it, that's stupid now, you should be able to that you should be able to come, fit out to the first page if it's relevant with the search query
[11/6, 7:49 AM] MirexTech: And I will love you to be nine templates loading so the for page one then the other one goes continue for page two exactly nine templates loading
[11/6, 7:54 AM] MirexTech: The worst part is the database dot PHP or they had been when I try to read a table schemer he is he is only telling me faith to faith to know something like a a pop up faith to something I need you to help me now help me so that even if he is coming out as a model or to a new page a view ehm PHP a a this thing just just help me please help me maybe if he is even a a get a get ehm get post request or something just help me.
[11/6, 7:56 AM] MirexTech: I need you to actually work properly on the backing codes, especially for the commission, both the front end so that athletes use the amount the user actually pay after the discount have been removed, not the total price because those little things can cause conflict later, so make sure there is no error, review the athlete admin relationship and communication and commission, so those are very importantb
