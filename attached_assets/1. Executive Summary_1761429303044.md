Title
Website Template Marketplace â€” MVP (Plain PHP, MySQL, WhatsApp first) ðŸš€

Introduction (problem and solution)

Problem â€” Manual delivery of templated websites is slow, error prone, and cannot scale with the celebrity affiliate campaign you secured. Administrators must manually track domains, sales, and affiliate commissions which creates delays and lost revenue.

Solution â€” Build a small fast portfolio marketplace using plain PHP and MySQL hosted on cPanel. Public users preview demos in an iframe, choose from pre-purchased available domains, fill a short onboarding form, and start a WhatsApp chat with a prefilled message while a pending order record is saved server side. Admins manage templates, domain inventory, orders, and affiliates from a secure admin panel. Affiliate commissions are tracked automatically and paid manually. This low automation approach fits your user base and hosting choice while enabling fast delivery and clean record keeping.

Key Decisions (core project choices)

No public referral program. Only admin created affiliates get official commission tracking. Informal referrals remain manual via WhatsApp.

Tech stack: Plain PHP, MySQL, cPanel hosting, PHPMailer for email, Bootstrap for UI, WhatsApp click to chat for payments and negotiation. No user registration for buyers in MVP.

Affiliate persistence: Capture ?aff=CODE in URL, persist via session and cookie for 30 days so purchases credit the affiliate even if the user navigates away.

Order flow: Form saves a pending order. Buyer is redirected to a prefilled WhatsApp chat. Admin confirms payment in WhatsApp then marks order as paid and assigns domain in admin.

Scope Boundaries

In Scope

Public portfolio and template list with iframe demos.

Per template simple onboarding form (dynamic fields supported).

Pending order recording, domain inventory, admin assignment of domains to orders, order status management.

Affiliate management (admin creates affiliate, code, dashboard for earnings and withdrawal requests).

WhatsApp based payment and negotiation flow; PHPMailer transactional emails after admin confirmation.

Out of Scope for MVP

Full automated provisioning of websites. (Manual provisioning or admin assisted deployment only)

Customer side account creation before purchase. Customers only get an account invitation after successful payment (optional).

Fully automated monthly payments and auto suspensions. These remain manual or cron assisted for now.

Stakeholders

Owner / Admin: primary operator who manages templates, domains, orders and affiliates.

Affiliates: celebrity and selected partners created by admin; they have a simple dashboard and request payouts.

Public Users / Buyers: browse templates, preview demos, and order using WhatsApp chat; no sign up required in MVP.

High Level Timeline and Milestones (phased)

Phase 0 Preparation â€” repository, cPanel setup, SSL, initial color system and Bootstrap.
Phase 1 Database and Core Models â€” create DB, users, templates, domains, orders, affiliates tables.
Phase 2 Public UI and Order Flow â€” templates grid, iframe demo modal, buy form, pending order creation, affiliate cookie/session logic.
Phase 3 Admin App â€” templates CRUD, domain inventory, pending orders with Mark Paid and Assign Domain, affiliate management and withdrawal processing.
Phase 4 Affiliate App â€” simple login, earnings, request withdrawal.
Phase 5 Reports, Exports and Testing â€” CSV exports, security checklist, manual end to end verification.

(These phases are organized to allow a developer to build the core MVP quickly and deploy on cPanel.)

Acceptances and Success Criteria

Public order form saves a pending order and redirects user to a working prefilled WhatsApp chat.

Admin can mark an order paid and assign domain so that domain status updates to in use and disappears from the public domain selection.

Affiliate code in URL persists across the session and is recorded on orders for commission calculation.

PHPMailer email is sent to buyer after admin marks order completed with website details.

Assumptions and Risks

Assumptions

cPanel hosting with PHP and MySQL is available.

Admin will manually provision and upload template instances to purchased domains.

Affiliates are paid manually by the admin after payout approval.

Risks and Mitigations

WhatsApp dependency: If users cannot access WhatsApp the conversion drops. Mitigation: also show a fallback contact email and phone on the success page.

Domain inventory shortage: only a few domains pre-bought can sell out. Mitigation: make domain assignment immediate and prepare a small buffer of extra domains per template.

Payment confusion: some buyers may be uncomfortable paying over chat. Mitigation: plan Paystack integration as optional future step and provide clear payment instructions in the WhatsApp message and email.
