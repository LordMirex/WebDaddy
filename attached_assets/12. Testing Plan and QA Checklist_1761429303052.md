Document 12: Testing Plan and QA Checklist

A comprehensive test plan ensures every feature works as intended. We’ll employ unit tests (verifying individual PHP functions), integration tests (checking interactions like form → database → WhatsApp), and manual end-to-end (E2E) tests (simulating full user flows on the live site)

Test Types:

Unit tests: Exercise individual functions (e.g. validating a PHP helper function).

Integration tests: Verify modules work together (e.g. submitting the order form correctly writes to the database and generates the WhatsApp link).

Manual End-to-End: A tester manually walks through key scenarios in a real browser (e.g. ordering a template, following the WhatsApp redirect, receiving the email). Atlassian recommends a few E2E tests for critical flows

Test Cases: (Sample cases based on requirements)

TC-01: Visit the landing page with ?aff=CODE. Verify the affiliate code (CODE) is stored in a cookie/session.

TC-02: Submit the order form with valid inputs. Confirm a new order record appears in the database.

TC-03: If no domain options are available for a template, the domain dropdown should be hidden or disabled.

TC-04: In the admin panel, mark an order as paid. Ensure the order’s status updates in the database.

TC-05: After an affiliate’s referral leads to a paid order, check the affiliate dashboard shows the earned commission.

Edge Cases:

Submitting the form without clicking the WhatsApp link (e.g. user closes page) – ensure partial orders don’t remain in “pending” forever.

Invalid form inputs (empty required fields, malformed email/phone) – the system should reject and display errors. It’s important to test that bad data does not break the app

Attempting to assign a domain that’s already sold – verify the code prevents duplicates.

Tools: Manual browser testing and inspection, plus verifying the database in phpMyAdmin. Use the browser’s developer console to inspect sessionStorage/cookies when testing affiliate links. (Automated testing frameworks like PHPUnit could be added later, but initial testing is manual.)

Bug Tracking Template: Each bug/issue should include:

ID / Title: A brief identifier (e.g. “BUG-01: Form not saving”).

Description: Detailed explanation of the problem.

Steps to Reproduce: Exact actions the tester performed.

Expected Result: What should have happened.

Actual Result: What actually occurred.

Status: (New, In Progress, Resolved)

Citing best practices: unit tests verify small code units, integration tests check multiple components together
