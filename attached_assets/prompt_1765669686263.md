Okay now this update is for the user features like what will they do I don't know much about this but you already understand how the check out page and their user account works together, okay so now the user account is going to have things like tracking so they'll be able to see all their others track others I don't know about all the pages that will be on the place and how do you user dashboard or profile would be like or the pages or the now you're the one that is to decide all that and decide the changes an eye to affect database and I to affect the admin the affiliate and mostly the database structure because most most things now are changing everything things like the payments and things now are not tied to the user so it's based amount for clarification and tracking so delivers now will not be smooth since on when I confirm a template they receive the email and they can still go to the user dashboard and see the later even without receiving the email and also you can still work on things like the other tables and analytics update the admins to and there might be some new columns away delivery system and change some things so this of this is very big what I really need you to do is to understand all this updates and not just write coding here but it made them correctly with the current codebase,  system, and database.


The major thing I need you to do is read txt 1 and txt 2 they contain more information about the update, so what you will do is not right any code but just create a create a folder call it system update and all you're going to do is read the whole base scan the code base do everything I'm going to do to know how you are going to implement the code then what you do is create the various markdown files you need for the full upgrade because you know I didn't see everything on it text I miss everything you are the one that is to research more on system because I don't have a competition s planning and implementation plan on the system update folder requirements the code the database changes everything I don't know the documents you need for your full faithful perfect up the or you are you just make sure you create all the money is going to is going to change the lot of things you don't need to back up anything you just need to look up look the update properly because you're not the one writing I'm going to give another code agents to do the work your job is to make sure that the agent, with reading all the docs and markdown on the system update folder, you should be able to write a Google to fully write code and update the system properly without any issue changing everything that need to be changed even so you make sure you are things like they even add to the area will know that they are things that are not in the documentation and rules that will be updated to like things that I don't even know about cuz I'm not a very experience developer even my promise it should be added to the madam you can convert it to Man down to improve the prompt and the markdowns on the system update folder.
