Document 13: Acceptance Test Plan

The User Acceptance Testing (UAT) plan formalizes final validation of all user-facing functionality

. We define realistic UAT Scenarios that mirror real customer journeys, and clear Pass/Fail Criteria. Once all criteria are met, stakeholders sign off on project completion.

UAT Scenarios: (Example end-to-end flow)

A new visitor browses the site, selects a template, and clicks “Order” with an affiliate code in the URL.

The visitor fills out the order form, then clicks the generated WhatsApp link to place the order.

The admin receives notification, logs into the admin panel, and marks the order as paid.

The system marks the chosen domain as sold, credits the affiliate with the commission, and sends a confirmation email to the user.

The affiliate logs into their dashboard and verifies the commission appears.

Pass/Fail Criteria: Every user story and requirement must be tested and pass. Specifically:

All functional flows (ordering, affiliate tracking, admin updates, notifications) work 100%.

The WhatsApp redirect link generation works in every tested case.

The admin and affiliate panels are secure and all features function correctly (login, status updates, commission display).

No critical or high-severity defects remain open.

Sign-Off Form: After testing, stakeholders complete a sign-off form confirming acceptance. Typical fields include:

Project Name: (Template Marketplace)

Date: of acceptance.

Status: Pass/Fail of acceptance tests.

Notes: Any comments or remaining issues.

Signature: By the client/project owner.

Acceptance testing verifies that the system meets user requirements from an end-user perspective
