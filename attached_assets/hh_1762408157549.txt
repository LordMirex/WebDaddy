okay I'll tell you right now is that the m i got what the structure in the database file when I click structure still fails to load but it i can delete the whole table. work on the site time it's like it's 1hour behind my country (Nigeria) And make the optimize (vacuum) work more better in boosting performance ad query speeds through the site. and for the auto backup I don't want 2 days or hourly backups for the Cron job I need just the code for backups of every twice a week, then there will be one of every month that is being sent as file attached directly to my admin email.

and also homepage page 1 is listing 9 templates instead of 10

the modals on affiliate are still not good enough ohh, what I want to work on is the post announcement that announcement there's no management and even time there's no timer because I'm going to be able to be sent in an aspect and still okay 5 hours and minutes just time to set time for the Post before eating removed from the users dashboard and also a management system that I can see the previous active and remove the last name or now edit them to a new audience t something.


and we are rounding up building so make sure anything that would make this site crash or trash in the hosting environment is taken care of now just like sessions or db, they are also two things I will like to point 



and this site is lacking good analystics for visit bounce rate and time spent 10 most click templates or viewed, and just things like that the admin need to see to know what's actually going on, also work the report chart properly, still not nice enough for me.

our email templates have too much space up down left right so work on a very beautiful template optimization and also most of our first messages land on spam so ensure the affliaetes are fully aware so they check their spam, also i can see the site logo on our email. I want the jpg logo as the logo there, another issue is that some messages especially to admin have bad formatting of some characters like this email (ð³ New Withdrawal Request
An affiliate has requested a withdrawal.

Withdrawal ID: #7

Affiliate: oghoghoobianke

Email: oghoghoobianke@gmail.com

Amount: â¦20,000,000.00) 


and also they are some bad or old spaces that have not been removed even when our codes has updated. like having email or business name where we don't use it again somewhere, why am saying this is because all the csv in the site I download is always broken having misplaced colomns and sometimes bad formatting.


for the affiliate there's currently no way for them to communicate with the admins or even email them or see their WhatsApp popup so help me architect something to solve this please and also if you have cool suggestions for the project too it will be great to have you







technically; 


**URGENT – ENGINEER MUST READ & ACT NOW**  
**Project: Affiliate Platform – Final Stabilization Before Launch**  
**Deadline: 48 hours for critical fixes. No excuses.**

---

### CRITICAL ISSUES (FIX OR SITE CRASHES)

1. **DATABASE STRUCTURE WON’T LOAD**  
   - Clicking **Structure** in phpMyAdmin = blank/error.  
   - I can delete tables but **cannot view schema**.  
   - **This is a BLOCKER.** Fix corruption, locks, or file permissions **NOW**.

2. **SITE TIME IS 1 HOUR BEHIND NIGERIA (Africa/Lagos)**  
   - All timestamps (logs, dashboard, emails) must show **correct local time**.  
   - Store in UTC, display in **Africa/Lagos (GMT+1)**.  
   - **No more excuses about server time.**

3. **OPTIMIZE / VACUUM IS WEAK**  
   - Queries are slow.  
   - Run `VACUUM` + `ANALYZE` automatically after heavy operations.  
   - **Goal: 30% faster queries site-wide.**  
   - Add nightly cron if needed.

---

### BACKUP SYSTEM – EXACTLY AS I WANT (NO HOURLY, NO 2-DAY)

- **Twice a week** (e.g., Tuesday & Friday) → save backup file.  
- **Once a month** (1st of month) → **attach file to email** sent to **admin@domain.com**.  
- **No other schedules.**  
- Keep only last **4 weekly** + **12 monthly** backups. Delete older.

---

### ANNOUNCEMENT SYSTEM – CURRENTLY USELESS

- I need **full control**:  
  - Post announcement  
  - Set **exact duration** (e.g., 5 hours 30 mins)  
  - Auto-remove from user dashboard when time is up  
- **Admin panel must show**:  
  - All past & active announcements  
  - Edit, delete, or extend any  
- **No half-work. This is core UX.**

---

### ANALYTICS DASHBOARD – BLIND ADMIN = DEAD PROJECT

Add **real admin analytics**:  
- Total visits, bounce rate, time on site  
- **Top 10 most viewed/clicked templates**  
- User behavior flow  
- **Beautiful charts** (not ugly tables)  
- Export to CSV (must open clean in Excel)

---

### EMAIL SYSTEM – BROKEN & UGLY

1. **Emails land in SPAM** → Fix DKIM/SPF/DMARC + warm up IP  
2. **Too much empty space** → Redesign template:  
   - Clean, modern, mobile-friendly  
   - **Use our JPG logo** (not missing or broken)  
3. **Garbled characters**:  
   - `â¦` → fix to `₦`  
   - `ð³` → fix emojis  
   - **All emails must be UTF-8 clean**

---

### CLEAN UP DEAD CODE & CSV EXPORTS

- Remove **all unused fields**: `business_name`, old email columns, etc.  
- **CSV downloads are broken**:  
   - Misaligned columns  
   - Bad encoding  
   - **Fix so Excel opens perfectly**

---

### AFFILIATE → ADMIN COMMUNICATION (MISSING!)

- Affiliates **cannot contact admin** → unacceptable.  
- Add:  
  - **Support ticket system** (in dashboard)  
  - **WhatsApp float button** (click → message admin)  
- Admin must see and reply to tickets.

---

### FINAL HARDENING – NO CRASHES ON HOSTING

**Check and fix**:  
- Session hijacking risk  
- DB connection leaks  
- Memory leaks from big queries  
- File permissions (DB file = 640, uploads = 750)  
- **Turn OFF error display in production**  
- Add pagination **everywhere** (no 10k-row tables)

---

### BONUS (IF YOU WANT TO IMPRESS ME)

- Affiliate referral link generator (auto-UTM)  
- Downloadable payout history (PDF)  
- Dark mode toggle  
- Login rate limiting (3 fails → 5 min ban)

---

### ENGINEER: YOUR ORDERS

1. **Reply “Understood” in 1 hour.**  
2. **Fix in this order**: DB → Time → Backup → Emails → Analytics → Announcements → Comms → Hardening.  
3. **No code push without demo.**  
4. **Full regression test before merge.**  
5. **If you break anything = you fix it same day.**

**This is not a request. This is launch or fail.**  
**Do it right. Do it fast. Do it now.**
