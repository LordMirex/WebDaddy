I've never even checked what it will do on sources. When sources happens, the product should be marked as paid. The admin should receive a notification or email that someone has paid for this product automatically with paystack. There's no need for you to go to the drop-down. For tools that require the admin, later when we are working on tools or templates, most times templates just need you to just select the domain when you are done. But when there is a failed transaction, the transaction should be on the term of failed, like rejected or something. So, I don't know whether it's failed or still on pending.
