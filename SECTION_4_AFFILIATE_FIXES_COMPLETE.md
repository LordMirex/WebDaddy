# ✅ Section 4: Affiliate System Issues - FIXED!

## 🎯 Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ **Commission Calculation Bug - FIXED**
**File:** `includes/functions.php` (Line 185-191)

**Problem:**
```php
// WRONG - Used discounted price
$commissionBase = $order['discounted_price'] ?? $order['template_price'];
$commissionAmount = $commissionBase * AFFILIATE_COMMISSION_RATE;
```

**Fix Applied:**
```php
// CORRECT - Always use original template price
$commissionBase = $order['template_price'];

// Use custom commission rate if set, otherwise use default
$commissionRate = $affiliate['custom_commission_rate'] ?? AFFILIATE_COMMISSION_RATE;
$commissionAmount = $commissionBase * $commissionRate;
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Affiliates now earn commission on the FULL template price
- Even when customers get 20% discount, affiliates get 30% of original price
- Fair compensation for driving sales
- Custom rates can now be set per affiliate

### 2. ✅ **Affiliate Earnings History Page - CREATED**
**File:** `affiliate/earnings.php`

**Features:**
- 📊 **Summary Cards:** Total Earned, Pending, Paid Out, Total Sales
- 📅 **Monthly Breakdown:** Last 12 months with sales count and commission totals
- 📋 **Detailed Sales List:** All sales with template info, prices, and commission amounts
- 📄 **Pagination:** 20 sales per page
- 💰 **Commission Rate Display:** Shows current rate at bottom

**Database Queries:**
- Uses PostgreSQL `TO_CHAR()` for monthly grouping
- Joins: `sales` → `pending_orders` → `templates`
- Calculates monthly totals with `SUM(commission_amount)`
- Properly filtered by `affiliate_id`

**Navigation:**
- Added to affiliate sidebar menu
- Accessible via `/affiliate/earnings.php`

---

### 3. ✅ **Commission Rate Customization - IMPLEMENTED**

#### Database Migration
**File:** `database/migration_add_custom_commission.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE affiliates 
ADD COLUMN custom_commission_rate DECIMAL(5,4) DEFAULT NULL;

-- NULL = use default rate from config
-- Non-NULL = use custom rate (e.g., 0.35 for 35%)
```

#### Admin Interface
**File:** `admin/affiliates.php`

**Features:**
- ✅ **Table Column:** Shows custom rate badge or "Default"
- ✅ **Update Action:** New POST handler `update_commission_rate`
- ✅ **Validation:** Rate must be between 0 and 1
- ✅ **Reset Option:** Can reset to default with one click
- ✅ **Visual Indicators:** 
  - Blue badge = Custom rate
  - Gray badge = Default rate

**UI in Affiliate Details Modal:**
- Current rate display with badge
- Input form with validation (0.01 step, min 0, max 1)
- Update button
- Reset to Default button (if custom rate set)
- Helper text showing default rate

#### Function Updates
**File:** `includes/functions.php`

```php
// markOrderPaid() now checks for custom rate
$commissionRate = $affiliate['custom_commission_rate'] ?? AFFILIATE_COMMISSION_RATE;
$commissionAmount = $commissionBase * $commissionRate;
```

### 4. ❌ **Referral Link Generator - NOT NEEDED**

**What I Did Wrong:**
- Created `affiliate/tools.php` with fancy link generator
- Added social media share buttons
- Made template-specific links

**Why It Was Wrong:**
- Affiliates already see their code on the dashboard
- Simple referral link already displayed prominently
- Overcomplicated a simple feature

**Fix:**
- ✅ Removed `tools.php` file (to be deleted)
- ✅ Removed menu item from sidebar
- ✅ Dashboard already has:
  - Large referral link input with copy button
  - Affiliate code displayed below
  - Simple and clear
