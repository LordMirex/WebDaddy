# Payment Flow Update Implementation Plan

**Project:** WebDaddy Empire - Bank Transfer Payment Flow  
**Date:** November 24, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 1 Complete - Database & Documentation Updated

---

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation of a new payment flow where customers:
1. View bank account details on the confirmation page (NOT customer details)
2. Manually transfer the exact amount to the business account
3. Send proof of payment via WhatsApp with two options:
   - "I have sent the money" (instant confirmation pathway)
   - "Discuss more on WhatsApp" (discussion pathway)

## Database Implementation Status

✅ **SQLite Settings Table**: The existing `settings` table is a flexible key-value store that automatically supports the three new bank settings:
- `site_account_number`
- `site_bank_name`
- `site_bank_number`

No schema changes required - these settings save/retrieve using the existing INSERT...ON CONFLICT mechanism.

---

## Phase 1: Admin Panel Bank Settings Addition ✅ COMPLETE

**Objective:** Add three new bank account fields to admin settings that can be configured by the admin.

### Tasks:

  - `site_account_number` - The bank account number to display to customers ✅
  - `site_bank_name` - The name of the bank (e.g., "Access Bank", "GTBank") ✅
  - `site_bank_number` - The bank code/number for identification ✅

- [x] **1.2** Update the settings form in `admin/settings.php`:

  - Include proper labels with icons (🏦 🏢 🔢) ✅
  - Add helpful descriptions under each field ✅
  - Ensure form sends these values in POST request ✅

  - Show the current values of account number, bank name, and bank number ✅
  - Use blue styling to highlight bank settings ✅

- [x] **1.4** Update database save logic in `admin/settings.php`:
  - Ensured three new settings saved to database using INSERT...ON CONFLICT pattern (lines 30-32) ✅
  - All three processed in the same settings array loop ✅
  - Proper sanitization added for all three inputs ✅

**Success Criteria:**
- Admin can save all three bank details on settings page

## Phase 2: Confirmation Page UI Redesign

**Objective:** Replace customer details card with bank payment details card and update instructions.

### Tasks:

- [ ] **2.1** Replace Customer Details Card (lines 571-590 in `cart-checkout.php`):

  - **REPLACE:** With new "Bank Payment Details" card showing:
    - Bank Account Number (with copy button/icon)
    - Bank Name
    - Bank Number/Code
  - Retrieve these values from settings using `getSetting()` function
  - Add styling: blue/bank-themed background, larger font for account number, copy icon

- [ ] **2.2** Update "Next Steps" instruction section (around line 592-598):
  - Change instruction text from "Click button to send order details"
  - TO: "Send the exact amount (₦{amount}) to the account details above, then click the button below with proof"
  - Make instructions clearer about needing exact amount transfer
  - Add note: "Screenshot your payment receipt to send as proof"

- [ ] **2.3** Replace WhatsApp button with two-button system (around line 601-607):
  - **Button 1:** "⚡ I have sent the money"
    - Badge/label: "Instant Confirmation"
    - Links to WhatsApp with "payment proof message"
  - **Button 2:** "💬 Discuss more on WhatsApp"
    - Alternative option
    - Links to WhatsApp with "discussion message"

  - Stack on mobile, side-by-side on desktop

**Success Criteria:**
- Bank details display instead of customer details
- Two WhatsApp buttons visible and clickable
- Instructions are clear about exact amount requirement

## Phase 3: WhatsApp Message Templates Update

**Objective:** Update message generation logic to support two different message flows based on button clicked.

### Tasks:

- [ ] **3.1** Update WhatsApp message generation in `cart-checkout.php` (around line 325-372):
  - **Current flow:** Single message asking for payment details from admin
  - **NEW - Message Type 1 (I have sent the money):**
    - Keep order ID, items, total amount
    - Add: "Send the exact amount [₦amount] to account details provided on website"
    - Add customer's bank details (account number, bank name, bank code)
    - End message: "Attached is the screenshot of my payment receipt"
    - Include instruction: "Please screenshot your payment transaction and send as proof"
  - **NEW - Message Type 2 (Discuss more):**
    - Keep order ID, items, total amount
    - Message: "I need more information about this order" or similar
    - Option to ask questions before paying
    - Different closing

- [ ] **3.2** Implement two separate WhatsApp URLs in PHP:
  - `$whatsappUrlPaymentProof` - For "I have sent the money" button
  - `$whatsappUrlDiscussion` - For "Discuss more" button
  - Both use proper message formatting (bold, emojis, line breaks)
  - Both properly URL-encoded

- [ ] **3.3** Update confirmation data array (around line 379-386):
  - Pass both WhatsApp URLs to the template: `$confirmationData['whatsappUrlPaymentProof']` and `$confirmationData['whatsappUrlDiscussion']`
  - Ensure bank settings are available in confirmation data for display

- [ ] **3.4** Message format specifications:
  - **Message Type 1 (Payment Proof):**
    ```
    🛒 *NEW ORDER REQUEST*
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    
    📋 *Order ID:* #[order_id]
    
    🎨 *TEMPLATES* ([count]):
    ✅ [product names]
    
    💳 *Amount to Pay:* [amount_formatted]
    
    🏦 *Payment Details:*
    Bank: [bank_name]
    Account: [account_number]
    Code: [bank_code]
    
    📸 Attached is the screenshot of my payment receipt
    ```
  
  - **Message Type 2 (Discussion):**
    ```
    🛒 *ORDER INQUIRY*
    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
    
    📋 *Order ID:* #[order_id]
    
    I need more information about this order before proceeding with payment. Let me discuss the details with you.
    ```

**Success Criteria:**
- Two different WhatsApp links generate with different messages
- Buttons link to correct WhatsApp messages
- Messages display order info, payment details, and appropriate calls-to-action
